- Open SQLite browser
- Load elements.db database
- Run the following SQL commands in `Execute SQL` tab
- select all
SELECT * FROM elements


- select only two columns
SELECT atomicNumber, symbol FROM elements

- select two columns with condition
SELECT atomicNumber, symbol FROM elements WHERE groupBlock='transition metal'

- join two tables on the atomicNumber column
SELECT elements.atomicNumber, symbol, oxidation_state FROM elements, oxidation WHERE  elements.atomicNumber=oxidation.atomicNumber

- join two tables. Add the condition:
SELECT elements.atomicNumber, symbol, oxidation_state FROM elements, oxidation WHERE  elements.atomicNumber=oxidation.atomicNumber AND  groupBlock='transition metal'

- Group by groupBlock and count the rows in each group:
SELECT groupBlock, COUNT(*) FROM elements GROUP BY groupBlock

- Group by groupBlock, count the rows in each group and sort by this number:
SELECT groupBlock, COUNT(*) FROM elements GROUP BY groupBlock ORDER BY COUNT(*) 

SELECT groupBlock, COUNT(*) FROM elements GROUP BY groupBlock ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC 

- Group by groupBlock, count the rows, compute average and minimum melting point in each group:
SELECT bondingType, COUNT(*), AVG(meltingPoint), MAX(meltingPoint) FROM elements GROUP BY bondingType ORDER BY AVG(meltingPoint) DESC 

- Count the number of valence electrons
SELECT   elements.symbol,  valence.* FROM elements, valence WHERE  elements.atomicNumber=valence.atomicNumber 

SELECT   elements.symbol,  sum(valence.number_electrons) FROM elements, valence WHERE  elements.atomicNumber=valence.atomicNumber GROUP BY symbol


Tasks write the queries to 
- find max value of melting point in each group block, order by melting point
- select elements with most negative and most positive oxidation state
- find the min and max melting temperature for each bonding type (bondingType column)
- find the elements with melting point close to room temperature (within +/- 50K range)

In some cases, it could be more than one query.
